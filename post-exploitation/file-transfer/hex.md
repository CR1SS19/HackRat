# HEX

In the scenario where the transfer of .exe files on a target Windows machine has been blocked, the [exe2hex](https://github.com/g0tmi1k/exe2hex) tool can be used to bypass it.

A tool that converts .exe to a series of hexadecimal strings, forming a script that can be run on the victim's machine to build an .exe again and run it.

### Linux Attacker

I will use the **nc.exe** file as an example to transfer it to the target machine.

I also use the [upx](https://github.com/upx/upx?tab=readme-ov-file) tool to reduce the file size so the script doesn't get too big

```bash
# Using Upx:
upx -9 nc.exe

# Using exe2hex:
exe2hex -x nc.exe -p nc.txt
```

The _**-p**_ option was used for the script to be rebuilt using PowerShell. In case of an older Windows system, you can use the _**-b**_ option to rebuild the script with DEBUG.exe.

### Windows Target

Now we can open the **nc.txt** script in a notepad, copy all the contents and paste it into the command line of the target system. In a few minutes the .exe file will be rebuilt and ready to run.
