# File Type

This is the case where we have access to a target server, but we don't have default options for file transfer, like wget, curl, etc.&#x20;

However, sometimes the application allows you to upload files with certain types of extensions or certain types of content. For example, the application allows us to upload a PDF file, with this we can forge a PDF with a binary inside the file and then we can extract this information from inside the file through the destination server.
